# calculate-the-area-and-perimeter-of-a-circle

This is a simple C program that allows a user to select a shape (circle, triangle, or square) and then perform some basic calculations on that shape (area, circumference, or perimeter). The program uses functions to calculate the area, circumference, and perimeter of each shape and then displays the results to the user.

The main function uses a do-while loop to repeatedly display a menu of options to the user and prompt them to select an option. The switch statement inside the loop then handles each option selected by the user.

For the circle option, the program prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle and then calculates the area and circumference using the circleArea and circleCircum functions. The displayCircle function then displays the radius, area, and circumference of the circle to the user.

For the triangle option, the program prompts the user to enter the base and height of the triangle and then calculates the area using the triangleArea function. The displayTriangle function then displays the base, height, and area of the triangle to the user.

For the square option, the program prompts the user to enter the side length of the square and then calculates the area and perimeter using the squareArea and squarePerimeter functions. The displaySquare function then displays the side length, area, and perimeter of the square to the user.

If the user selects the exit option, the program prints a message and exits the loop, ending the program.
